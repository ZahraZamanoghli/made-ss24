# Project Plan

## Title

<!-- Give your project a short title. -->

Assessing the Role of Individual Consumption Behavior in Climate Change Mitigation

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->

1. What are the primary drivers of carbon emissions associated with individual consumption, and how do they compare across different categories of goods and services?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

XY is an important problem, because... This projects analyzes XY, using method A. The results can give insights into...

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Consumption footprint

- Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/uwxw0e70pgohx48bmhyqq?locale=en
- Data URL:
- Data Type: CSV

The indicator consumption footprint estimates the environmental impacts of EU and Member States consumption by combining data on consumption intensity and environmental impacts of representative products. The indicator covers five areas of consumption: food, mobility, housing, appliances, and household goods. Consumption intensities are calculated based on consumption statistics.

### Datasource2: EU CO2 emissions from the production and consumption (footprint) perspectives (FIGARO application)

- Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/uocqtyovqvhxfbleg5fkwq?locale=en
- Data URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/egi_co2_1?format=SDMX-CSV&compressed=true
- Data Type: CSV

The dataset presents modelling estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) 'embodied' in products (goods and services) for final demand - also referred to as 'footprints'. The estimates are the result of environmental input-output modelling and cover the entire world economy.
